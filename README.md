Apriori-Miner-Association-Rules
===============================

For this project we will extract association rules from an interesting data set of your choice.  Therefore, project will consist of two main components:  (1) defining your data set of choice  (2) implementing the a-priori algorithm for finding association rules.   Data Set Definition  For this project, we will use the official New York City data sets that are available at the NYC Open Data site, at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/. We can access the data sets at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/browse?limitTo=datasets. There is a wide variety of data sets, and an important part of this project is that you explore these data sets and pick one or more for use in the project.
